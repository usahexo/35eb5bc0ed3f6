<h1 id="Unlocking-European-Roulette-On-Mfortune"><a href="#Unlocking-European-Roulette-On-Mfortune" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking European Roulette On Mfortune"></a>Unlocking European Roulette On Mfortune</h1><p>Many people enjoy gambling, but not everyone is familiar with all the variations of the games available. If you are interested in playing roulette, there are a few things you should know about the European variety.</p>
<p>The first difference between European and American roulette is that the European game has a single zero pocket, while the American game has both a single and double zero pocket. This increased house edge makes it less favourable for players in the American game.</p>
<p>Another key difference is that in European roulette, each player can make up to three bets on different areas of the table layout. In American roulette, players typically only make two bets - on black or red, or on high or low numbers.</p>
<p>One final difference is that in European roulette, players are not penalised for betting on unlikely outcomes (e.g. betting on 34 when only 18 numbers are possible). In contrast, in American roulette players lose their entire bet if they select an incorrect number. This rule change makes European roulette much more favourable for players.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to try your hand at a game of European roulette, be sure to check out Mfortune – one of the leading online casinos for UK players!</p>
