	  <h1 id="Follow-these-tips-and-you’ll-be-a-roulette-pro-in-no-time"><a href="#Follow-these-tips-and-you’ll-be-a-roulette-pro-in-no-time" class="headerlink" title="Follow these tips and you’ll be a roulette pro in no time!"></a>Follow these tips and you’ll be a roulette pro in no time!</h1><p>Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world and it can be a lot of fun to play. However, if you want to make the most of your roulette experience and increase your chances of winning, then you need to know what you’re doing. In this article, we’re going to share some tips that will help you become a pro at roulette.</p>
<h1 id="1-Know-the-odds"><a href="#1-Know-the-odds" class="headerlink" title="1: Know the odds"></a>1: Know the odds</h1><p>The first thing you need to do is understand the odds of each bet that you can make. There are lots of different betting options available in roulette, so make sure you know the odds for each one before placing a bet. This will help you make informed decisions and give you a better chance of winning money.</p>
<h1 id="2-Stick-to-simple-bets"><a href="#2-Stick-to-simple-bets" class="headerlink" title="2: Stick to simple bets"></a>2: Stick to simple bets</h1><p>There are a lot of complex betting strategies out there that promise big rewards, but the truth is that these strategies are often risky and they don’t always work. It’s usually best to stick to simple bets until you’re confident enough to try out more complicated ones. This will help reduce your chances of losing money and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="3-Play-with-a-budget"><a href="#3-Play-with-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3: Play with a budget"></a>3: Play with a budget</h1><p>It’s important to remember that roulette is a game of chance, so there is no guarantee that you will win money every time you play. That’s why it’s important to set yourself a budget and stick to it. If you lose all your money, then you won’t be able to continue playing and that can ruin the fun altogether. So remember, gamble responsibly and have fun!</p>
<h1 id="Master-the-art-of-roulette-with-these-easy-tips"><a href="#Master-the-art-of-roulette-with-these-easy-tips" class="headerlink" title="Master the art of roulette with these easy tips!"></a>Master the art of roulette with these easy tips!</h1><p>If you’re looking to up your game at the roulette table, look no further! These easy tips will help you play like a pro and increase your chances of winning big.</p>
<h1 id="1-Choose-Your-Numbers-Wisely"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Numbers-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="1: Choose Your Numbers Wisely"></a>1: Choose Your Numbers Wisely</h1><p>When you’re playing roulette, it’s important to choose your numbers wisely. You don’t want to just pick any old numbers - you want to go for the ones that have the best odds of winning.</p>
<p>Some of the best numbers to choose are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The number 1 (has a House edge of 2.7%)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number 2 (has a House edge of 2.7%)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number 3 (has a House edge of 2.7%)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number 4 (has a House edge of 2.63%)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number 5 (has a House edge of 2.63%)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number 6 (has a House edge of 2.63%)<br> alternatively, use one of the numerous betting systems out there to give yourself an advantage over the house</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, avoid choosing high numbers like 19 or 20, as they have among the worst odds in the game. Instead, try low numbers like 1 or 2 to give yourself a better chance of winning.</p>
<h1 id="Secrets-to-winning-at-roulette-revealed"><a href="#Secrets-to-winning-at-roulette-revealed" class="headerlink" title="Secrets to winning at roulette revealed!"></a>Secrets to winning at roulette revealed!</h1><p>Modern casinos are all fitted with digital roulette tables that use a Random Number Generator (RNG) to determine the winning number. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help you increase your chances of winning when playing this popular casino game.</p>
<h1 id="1-–-Play-European-Roulette"><a href="#1-–-Play-European-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="1 – Play European Roulette"></a>1 – Play European Roulette</h1><p>The odds of winning at roulette are the same for both American and European roulette, but the house edge is different. The house edge for American roulette is 5.26%, while it is just 2.7% for European roulette. So, if you want to improve your chances of winning, play European Roulette instead of American Roulette.</p>
<h1 id="2-–-Bet-on-Black-or-Red"><a href="#2-–-Bet-on-Black-or-Red" class="headerlink" title="2 – Bet on Black or Red"></a>2 – Bet on Black or Red</h1><p>Most people bet on either red or black when playing roulette, and this is a smart move. The odds of winning are almost 50&#x2F;50 when betting in this way, so it’s a good way to limit your losses and increase your chances of winning at the same time.</p>
<h1 id="3-–-Place-Inside-Bets"><a href="#3-–-Place-Inside-Bets" class="headerlink" title="3 – Place Inside Bets"></a>3 – Place Inside Bets</h1><p>When playing roulette, you can place bets on different sections of the table layout. The best bets to make are “inside bets”, which are bets placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers. These bets offer better odds than outside bets (bets placed on areas of the table other than specific numbers), so they are a better option if you want to maximise your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="4-–-Avoid-Odd-x2F-Even-Bets"><a href="#4-–-Avoid-Odd-x2F-Even-Bets" class="headerlink" title="4 – Avoid Odd&#x2F;Even Bets"></a>4 – Avoid Odd&#x2F;Even Bets</h1><p>Another type of bet that you should avoid when playing roulette is an odd&#x2F;even bet. This is because the odds of winning are only 50&#x2F;50, so you have a 50% chance of losing your money each time you make this bet.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-beat-the-casinos-at-their-own-game-by-using-Einstein’s-tips"><a href="#How-to-beat-the-casinos-at-their-own-game-by-using-Einstein’s-tips" class="headerlink" title="How to beat the casinos at their own game - by using Einstein’s tips!"></a>How to beat the casinos at their own game - by using Einstein’s tips!</h1><p>In 1907, Albert Einstein put forward a paper that proposed the theory of Brownian motion. This theory demonstrated that dust particles in a liquid were constantly being buffeted by the molecules around them.</p>
<p>This theory was later used to help justify the mathematical models used by casinos to calculate their odds. In fact, if you know what to look out for, you can use these same models to beat the casinos at their own game!</p>
<p>Here are three tips from Einstein that will help you do just that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for patterns in the numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>If you study the way that numbers are distributed around the roulette wheel, or within the decks of cards in blackjack, you can start to see patterns emerging. By betting according to these patterns, you can give yourself a better chance of winning!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use math to your advantage</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only can you look for patterns in numbers, but you can also use math to your advantage. For example, if you are playing blackjack and have an ace and a ten-point card totalling 20, then you should bet on black as it is more likely to come up than red. This is because there are 16 black cards in a deck, compared with just four red ones.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep track of what the casino is doing</li>
</ol>
<p> casinos are always trying new ways to lure in customers and take their money. By keeping track of what they are doing - whether it be changing the rules of a game or introducing new games -you can stay ahead of them and make sure they don’t take your money!</p>
<h1 id="Roulette-tips-from-the-mind-that-changed-the-world-Albert-Einstein"><a href="#Roulette-tips-from-the-mind-that-changed-the-world-Albert-Einstein" class="headerlink" title="Roulette tips from the mind that changed the world - Albert Einstein!"></a>Roulette tips from the mind that changed the world - Albert Einstein!</h1><p>Most of you who have gambled at roulette, would have heard of the theory of relativity, unless you spent all your time on casino floors and never ventured outside the gambling osphere. But, even if you don’t know who Albert Einstein is, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of his most famous equation: e &#x3D; mc2.</p>
<p>What many people don’t know is that Einstein was also a major roulette player and theorist. In fact, he is credited with coming up with some of the most important tips that can help improve your chances when playing this casino game.</p>
<p>Here are three Einstein-isms that can help you improve your roulette game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always double down on eleven<br>This may be one of the simplest Einstein tips, but it’s also one of the most effective. When the dealer shows an ace and you have an eleven (or any combination totalling eleven), always double down. You’ll reduce the house edge significantly by doing this – from 1.35% to just 0.68%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on black or redA popular betting strategy amongst roulette players is to bet on black or red. This has a 50% chance of winning and, therefore, reduces the house edge to 2.63%. So long as you stick to betting low stakes, this is a good way to minimise your losses over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay away from evens betsThe odds may be attractive when betting on evens such as black&#x2F;red, odd&#x2F;even and high&#x2F;low, but these bets come with a house edge of 5.26%. Therefore, it’s best to avoid them if possible and focus on other areas of the table where the odds are more favourable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
