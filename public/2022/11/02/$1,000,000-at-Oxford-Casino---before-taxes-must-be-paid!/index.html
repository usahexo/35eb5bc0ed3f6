	  <h1 id="1-000-000-at-Oxford-Casino-before-taxes-must-be-paid"><a href="#1-000-000-at-Oxford-Casino-before-taxes-must-be-paid" class="headerlink" title="$1,000,000 at Oxford Casino - before taxes must be paid!"></a>$1,000,000 at Oxford Casino - before taxes must be paid!</h1><p>Casino gambling is a great form of entertainment. It can be exciting, and it can provide a chance to win big money. However, it is important for people to remember that when they gamble in a casino, they are still taking a risk. The money that they gamble with is not theirs until they have won it back and then some.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a story in the news about a man who won $1 million at the Oxford Casino in Maine. While this may sound like an amazing windfall, the man will actually only take home around $600,000 after taxes are paid. This goes to show that when people gamble in a casino, they need to be aware of the potential taxes that will be owed on any winnings.</p>
<p>In most cases, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This means that any amount of money that is won while gambling needs to be reported on tax returns. For federal taxes, gambling income is considered taxable if it exceeds $600 in a year. For state taxes, the rules vary from state to state. In some states, all gambling income is considered taxable, while other states only tax certain types of gambling income.</p>
<p>It is important for people to understand the tax rules related to gambling before they start playing casino games. This way they can be sure to properly report any winnings and avoid any problems with the IRS or state tax authorities. Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it is important to remember that there are risks involved, and those risks include having to pay taxes on any winnings.</p>
<h1 id="Oxford-Casino-Doubles-Down-On-Tax-Free-Winnings"><a href="#Oxford-Casino-Doubles-Down-On-Tax-Free-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Oxford Casino Doubles Down On Tax-Free Winnings!"></a>Oxford Casino Doubles Down On Tax-Free Winnings!</h1><p>In March of 2018, Oxford Casino announced that it would be doubling down on tax-free jackpot winnings for its customers. The casino, which is located in Oxford, Maine, said that it planned to offer the same tax breaks for those who hit jackpots as it does for players who hit poker or blackjack hands.</p>
<p>This move comes as a response to recent changes made by the Maine legislature that eliminated the state’s casino taxation scheme. Under the new rules, casinos in Maine are now required to pay taxes on all of their gambling revenues. Previously, they had been taxed only on profits.</p>
<p>According to Oxford Casino General Manager Dave Kreegel, the change in the law “necessitates that we take a fresh look at our player proposition and make sure that we are doing everything possible to create an entertaining and rewarding gaming experience for our guests.”</p>
<p>The new policy applies not just to jackpots won on slot machines, but also to table games like poker and blackjack. In addition, any related winnings from tournaments will also be exempt from taxation.</p>
<p>Oxford Casino isn’t the only casino in Maine making changes in light of the new legislation. In fact, both Hollywood Casino and Crossroads Casino have announced similar plans to offer tax-free jackpots.</p>
