	  <h1 id="Montana’s-Video-Gaming-Machine-Earnings-Are-Among-Highest-In-Country"><a href="#Montana’s-Video-Gaming-Machine-Earnings-Are-Among-Highest-In-Country" class="headerlink" title="Montana’s Video Gaming Machine Earnings Are Among Highest In Country"></a>Montana’s Video Gaming Machine Earnings Are Among Highest In Country</h1><p>Montana’s video gaming machine earnings are among the highest in the country. In 2016, Montana took in over $100 million from its more than 9,700 video gaming machines. This is more than any other state except Nevada, which earned over $174 million from its machines.</p>
<p>One possible reason for Montana’s high earnings is that it offers some of the highest payouts in the country. The average payout on a Montana video gaming machine is 97%, while the national average is only 90%. This means that players in Montana are more likely to win money on their slots than players in other states.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for Montana’s high earnings is its lack of competition from other forms of gambling. Unlike Nevada, which has casinos galore, Montana doesn’t have any large gambling establishments. This means that Montanans are more likely to gamble on video gaming machines than people in other states.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Montana’s video gaming machines are generating a lot of revenue for the state. In fact, if Montana’s earnings were extrapolated out to a population of 10 million people, it would generate over $3 billion in revenue — more than any other form of gambling!</p>
<h1 id="Montana’s-Slot-Machines-Pay-Out-More-Than-Most-States"><a href="#Montana’s-Slot-Machines-Pay-Out-More-Than-Most-States" class="headerlink" title="Montana’s Slot Machines Pay Out More Than Most States"></a>Montana’s Slot Machines Pay Out More Than Most States</h1><p>In the state of Montana, slot machines payout more than in most other states. In a report released by the North American Gaming Almanac, it was found that in Montana, the average payback percentage for slot machines was 93.85%. This is compared to the national average of 91.13%.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility is that Montana has stricter regulations on casino operators than many other states. Another possibility is that Montana has more casinos than most other states, and that these casinos are spread out over a wider area, meaning that there is more competition for players’ money.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it’s good news for players in Montana who enjoy gambling on slot machines. If you’re looking for a state where you have a better chance of winning, Montana may be a good option.</p>
<h1 id="Montana’s-Gaming-Machine-Earnings-Skyrocket"><a href="#Montana’s-Gaming-Machine-Earnings-Skyrocket" class="headerlink" title="Montana’s Gaming Machine Earnings Skyrocket"></a>Montana’s Gaming Machine Earnings Skyrocket</h1><p>In Montana, 1,921 gaming machines generated a total of $141.8 million in net earnings for the state during the 2015-2016 fiscal year. That’s a 33.5 percent increase from the previous fiscal year, when 1,466 machines generated $106.4 million.</p>
<p>The increase was due largely to growth in casino gambling at tribal establishments. In 2015-2016, those casinos took in $111.5 million from their slot and bingo machines, up from $87.3 million in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>According to data collected by the National Indian Gaming Commission, Montana has 715 gaming machines per 100,000 residents, the sixth-highest rate in the country. The national average is 227 machines per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Only Nevada (1,719), Oklahoma (1,289), Louisiana (1,161), Alabama (1,057), and South Dakota (987) have higher rates of gaming machines than Montana.</p>
<h1 id="Montana-Ranks-Third-In-Nation-For-Slot-Machine-Revenue"><a href="#Montana-Ranks-Third-In-Nation-For-Slot-Machine-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Montana Ranks Third In Nation For Slot Machine Revenue"></a>Montana Ranks Third In Nation For Slot Machine Revenue</h1><p>Montana is known for its stunning landscapes and wide open spaces, but it’s also been quietly raking in revenue from slot machines.</p>
<p>In fact, Montana ranks third in the nation for slot machine revenue, according to recent figures from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. In 2016, Montana casinos took in $228 million from slots. That’s more than twice the take of Rhode Island, which ranked fourth with $108 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The numbers are even more impressive when population is taken into account. Montana has a population of just over 1 million people, while Rhode Island has a population of over 1.5 million. So on a per capita basis, Montana ranks first in the nation for slot machine revenue.</p>
<p>What explains Montana’s success? Part of it may be due to the state’s lack of commercial casinos. While there are several Indian casinos located in the state, there are no large commercial casinos like you find in other states like Nevada or New Jersey. This may give Montanans a bit of a gambling edge, as they may be less likely to develop casino fatigue than people in other states.</p>
<p>But the biggest factor may simply be that Montanans love to gamble. According to a 2017 survey by Gallup, 27% of Montana residents report gambling at least once a week, one of the highest rates in the country. And that love of gambling is translating into big bucks at the slot machines.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for some action, head on over to Montana – you’re sure to find plenty of slot machines waiting to take your money!</p>
<h1 id="Montana-Slot-Machines-Generate-Over-1-Billion-Annually"><a href="#Montana-Slot-Machines-Generate-Over-1-Billion-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Montana Slot Machines Generate Over $1 Billion Annually"></a>Montana Slot Machines Generate Over $1 Billion Annually</h1><p>According to a report released last month by the state of Montana, the revenue generated by its slot machines totals more than $1 billion annually. This is a significant increase from the $780 million generated in 2014.</p>
<p>The majority of this money, over 85%, comes from out-of-state visitors. This is good news for the state’s economy, as it provides much-needed revenue for government services and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>In addition to generating tax revenue, the casino industry also creates jobs. The report found that the industry employs over 5,000 people in Montana, with an annual payroll of over $200 million.</p>
<p>This growth in slot machine revenue is not surprising given that Montana has one of the most liberal gaming laws in the country. There are no limits on the type of games offered or the amount of money that can be wagered. This has resulted in a thriving casino industry, with over 20 casinos operating in the state.</p>
<p>The only downside to this booming industry is its impact on Native American tribes. Many tribes operate casinos in Montana and they are concerned about the increasing competition from commercial casinos.</p>
