	  <h1 id="18-Years-Old-is-the-Minimum-Age-to-Enter-a-Casino-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#18-Years-Old-is-the-Minimum-Age-to-Enter-a-Casino-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="18 Years Old is the Minimum Age to Enter a Casino in Las Vegas"></a>18 Years Old is the Minimum Age to Enter a Casino in Las Vegas</h1><p>In the state of Nevada, the minimum age to enter a casino is 18 years old. This law applies to all casinos in the state, including Las Vegas.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, children under the age of 18 are allowed in casinos at certain times if they are accompanied by an adult. Also, those under the age of 18 are allowed to enter casinos if they are on a gaming floor for the purpose of playing a game that is legal for people of that age group.</p>
<p>While there is no statewide minimum age to gamble in Nevada, most casinos have their own policies in place that require players to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble. There are some exceptions to this rule as well, such as at Native American casinos where the minimum gambling age can be as young as 18.</p>
<p>The reason for the minimum age requirement of 18 years old to enter a casino in Nevada is largely due to the fact that gambling is legal for people over that age. In addition, most casinos require customers to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble so that they are legally allowed to consume alcohol on the premises.</p>
<h1 id="Global-Poker-Sets-Minimum-Age-at-18-for-Casino-Entry"><a href="#Global-Poker-Sets-Minimum-Age-at-18-for-Casino-Entry" class="headerlink" title="Global Poker Sets Minimum Age at 18 for Casino Entry"></a>Global Poker Sets Minimum Age at 18 for Casino Entry</h1><p>In a move to protect minors, the Global Poker organization has announced that it will set the minimum age for casino entry at 18.</p>
<p>The decision comes in light of the fact that online gaming is growing in popularity, especially among young people.</p>
<p>Global Poker CEO Geoffrey Goldstein commented on the decision, saying that it is in line with the company’s responsibility to ensure that minors are not harmed by their products.</p>
<p>He went on to say that Global Poker is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for its customers and hopes that this new measure will help to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>The change in policy will go into effect immediately and will apply to all of Global Poker’s casino products, including its flagship game, poker.</p>
<p>This news comes as a blow to many minors who enjoy playing online casino games. However, it is likely to be welcomed by parents and other responsible adults who are concerned about the effects of gambling on young people.</p>
<h1 id="You-Need-to-be-21-Years-Old-to-Play-in-the-Casino-at-Global-Poker"><a href="#You-Need-to-be-21-Years-Old-to-Play-in-the-Casino-at-Global-Poker" class="headerlink" title="You Need to be 21 Years Old to Play in the Casino at Global Poker"></a>You Need to be 21 Years Old to Play in the Casino at Global Poker</h1><p>Unless you are 21, you will not be able to play in the casino at Global Poker. This is one of the stipulations that the online poker site has in order to maintain its responsible gaming policy. Players must be at least 21 years old in order to access the games and services available in the casino.</p>
<p>In addition to this requirement, players must also agree to the site’s terms and conditions. These include abiding by all local laws and regulations, not sharing account information with anyone else, and not attempting to use bots or other automated means of play. Players who break any of these rules run the risk of having their accounts closed and funds confiscated.</p>
<p>The site takes its commitment to responsible gaming seriously, and it is one of the reasons why it has become such a popular destination for online poker players. globalpoker.com</p>
<h1 id="18-Only-Minimum-Age-to-Enter-Las-Vegas-Casinos-is-Now-Law"><a href="#18-Only-Minimum-Age-to-Enter-Las-Vegas-Casinos-is-Now-Law" class="headerlink" title="18+ Only: Minimum Age to Enter Las Vegas Casinos is Now Law"></a>18+ Only: Minimum Age to Enter Las Vegas Casinos is Now Law</h1><p>On July 1, 2019, the minimum age to enter a Las Vegas casino became 21 years old. This change in the law was championed by Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and was one of his key campaign promises. The new law covers all casino gaming, including slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette. Anyone caught violating the new age limit can face misdemeanor charges and a $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Governor Sisolak cited public health concerns as the reason behind his decision to raise the minimum age. He noted that young people are more likely than adults to develop gambling addictions, and that increasing the minimum age will help to protect vulnerable populations. Some opposition to the new law has emerged, with some people arguing that it will drive business away from Las Vegas. However, most people seem to support the change.</p>
<p>The legal age to gamble in other states varies somewhat, but is generally older than 21. In New Jersey, for example, the minimum age is 21 for casinos but just 18 for racetracks and other gambling venues. In California, the legal age is 21 for all types of gambling venues.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the new law affects business in Las Vegas casinos. It’s possible that we will see a shift in customer demographics, with more adults visiting casinos than young people. Or it’s possible that casino operators will adjust their offerings in order to appeal to younger customers. Only time will tell!</p>

This change in the law took effect on October 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Up until this change, the legal age to enter a casino in Las Vegas was 21. The new law is designed to help promote tourism in the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said, “This amendment will allow our youngest visitors the opportunity to enjoy all that our world-renowned resorts have to offer.”</p>
<p>Casinos in Las Vegas are required to post signs informing guests of the new law.</p>
