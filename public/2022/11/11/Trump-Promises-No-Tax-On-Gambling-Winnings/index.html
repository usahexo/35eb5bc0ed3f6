	  <h1 id="Trump-Promises-No-Tax-On-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Trump-Promises-No-Tax-On-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Trump Promises No Tax On Gambling Winnings"></a>Trump Promises No Tax On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>Donald Trump has recently announced that he plans to exempt gambling winnings from any taxes. This is great news for avid gamblers and casino goers, as they will now be able to keep more of their hard-earned money.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a way to attract more people to casinos and gaming establishments, as they will now be able to keep more of their profits. Additionally, it is also likely to boost the economy as a whole, as people will have more money to spend on other things.</p>
<p>Trump has long been a proponent of gambling, and this latest announcement is just one of many policies he has put in place to benefit the industry. In addition to exempting gambling winnings from taxes, he has also vowed to reduce regulations on casinos and other gaming establishments.</p>
<p>This could lead to a major resurgence in the gambling industry, which has struggled in recent years due to increased regulation and competition from other forms of entertainment. Trump’s policies could reverse this trend and help the industry thrive once again.</p>
<p>This is great news for casino owners and employees, who stand to benefit from the increase in business. It is also good news for consumers, who will now have more money to spend on gambling activities.</p>

<h1 id="Is-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Free-In-Your-State"><a href="#Is-Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Free-In-Your-State" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling Winnings Tax-Free In Your State?"></a>Is Gambling Winnings Tax-Free In Your State?</h1><p>Each state has its own set of gambling laws, so it’s important to check with your state government to see if gambling winnings are taxable. In some states, all gambling winnings are taxable, while other states exempt certain types of winnings or only tax them on winnings that exceed a certain amount.</p>
<p>There are a few federal laws that also apply to gambling winnings. The first is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), which requires employers to withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from employees’ wages. These taxes are applied to all wages, including gambling winnings. The second is the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prohibits banks and other financial institutions from processing payments for illegal online gambling activities. However, this law does not apply to legal offline gambling activities.</p>
<p>If you live in a state that taxes gambling winnings, you may be able to claim them as income on your tax return. To do so, you will need to report your total winnings for the year on Line 21 of Form 1040. If you have any losses, you can deduct them from your winnings on Line 28 of Form 1040. You can find more information about reporting gambling income and losses in IRS Publication 535, Business Expenses.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Avoid-Paying-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-To-Avoid-Paying-Taxes-On-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How To Avoid Paying Taxes On Gambling Winnings"></a>How To Avoid Paying Taxes On Gambling Winnings</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there are two types of people: those who win and those who lose. For the winners, there’s the excitement of possibly winning big and the potential for a tax-free payday. But for the losers, there’s the agony of losing money and the possibility of having to pay taxes on their losses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways for winners to avoid paying taxes on their gambling winnings. Here are four tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Report Your Winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to report your winnings to the IRS. This can be done by filing Form 1040, Schedule C, Line 12. Be sure to include all winning dollar amounts, regardless of whether they’re from casino games, lotteries, or horse racing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Claim a Gambling Loss Deduction</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve lost money while gambling, you may be able to deduct those losses from your taxable income. This can be done by filing Form 1040, Schedule A, Line 21. The deductions are limited to the amount of your winnings, so be sure to keep track of both your winnings and your losses.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Claim a Gambling Loss Carryover</li>
</ol>
<p>If you didn’t have enough losses in the current year to offset your gambling profits, you may be able to carryover some of those losses into future years. This can be done by filing Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You must file this form within 3 years after the year in which you had the taxable gambling gain.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use Non-taxable Funds To Gamble</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re trying to minimize your tax liability, it’s best not to gamble with funds that are already taxed. For example, if you earn interest on a bank account or dividends from stocks, those earnings are already subject to income tax. It’s better to gamble with untaxed funds such as proceeds from a sale of property or an inheritance.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable"><a href="#Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Are Gambling Winnings Taxable?"></a>Are Gambling Winnings Taxable?</h1><p>The answer to this question is not as straightforward as one might think. Gambling winnings are considered taxable income by the IRS, but there are a few exceptions.</p>
<p>For starters, gambling winnings are only taxable if they exceed the amount of losses incurred while gambling. In other words, you can’t simply report all of your gambling income and hope for the best; you need to keep track of your losses as well.</p>
<p>There are also some gambling activities that are exempt from taxation. This includes most state-run lotteries, as well as certain casino games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette. However, any other type of casino game or betting activity is considered taxable income.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that just because you didn’t win anything doesn’t mean you don’t have to report gambling income. Any wins or losses from gambling must be included on your tax return.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how gambling income should be reported, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-Rules-For-Taxing-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-Rules-For-Taxing-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies Rules For Taxing Gambling Winnings"></a>IRS Clarifies Rules For Taxing Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released new guidance on the taxation of gambling winnings. The guidance, which was published in IRS Notice 2019-11, provides clarification on when gambling winnings are taxable and how they should be reported.</p>
<p>The rules for taxing gambling winnings are relatively simple. Gambling winnings are taxable income and should be reported on your tax return in the year that they are earned. This includes both winning bets and casino or lottery payouts.</p>
<p>However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of the winning bet or payout. Any excess losses cannot be deducted from other types of income. In addition, certain gambling-related expenses can be deducted as itemized deductions on your tax return.</p>
<p>The new guidance from the IRS provides clarification on several aspects of the taxation of gambling winnings. First, it confirms that all forms of gambling are taxable, including poker tournaments, horse racing, and slots machines.</p>
<p>The notice also specifies that the proceeds from a “progressive” wager are subject to tax regardless of whether the individual gambler ultimately wins or loses the bet. In other words, even if you only gamble a small amount on a progressive wager, you will still have to report the entire amount as taxable income.</p>
<p>Another issue addressed by the new guidance is how to report gambling winnings when you have multiple sources of income. In these cases, you must include all of your gambling winnings on your tax return and deduct any losses from all sources. You cannot cherry pick individual bets or casino payouts to offset against other income.</p>
<p>One final note: The new guidance specifically mentions that taxpayers who received payments in 2018 related to winning bets made in 2017 should report those payments on their 2018 tax returns. This means that taxpayers who won big in Las Vegas or at state lotteries last year may have to wait until next spring to file their returns!</p>
