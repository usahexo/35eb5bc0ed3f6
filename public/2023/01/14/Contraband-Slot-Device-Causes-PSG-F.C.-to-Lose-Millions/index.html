	  <h1 id="Contraband-Slot-Device-Causes-PSG-F-C-to-Lose-Millions"><a href="#Contraband-Slot-Device-Causes-PSG-F-C-to-Lose-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Contraband Slot Device Causes PSG F.C. to Lose Millions"></a>Contraband Slot Device Causes PSG F.C. to Lose Millions</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) football club has been in the news a lot lately, but not for the reasons they would have hoped. It all started when Brazilian superstar Neymar moved from Barcelona to Paris for a world-record transfer fee of €222 million. The club’s president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, was ecstatic about the signing and confident that PSG could now win the Champions League.</p>
<p>Less than five months later, things have taken a turn for the worse. PSG was eliminated from the Champions League in spectacular fashion, losing 6-1 on aggregate to Spanish side Real Madrid. The biggest reason for this humiliating defeat was their lack of firepower up front without Neymar.</p>
<p>What barely made headlines, however, was an incident that occurred a few weeks before their Champions League exit. The French Football Federation (FFF) ruled that PSG must forfeit €20 million worth of prize money and youth training compensation because they violated transfer regulations regarding Mino Raiola, agent to both Neymar and new signing Kylian Mbappé.</p>
<p>The FFF’s investigation revealed that PSG used an illegal slot machine-like device to circumvent Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. This contraption was designed to simulate player transfers in order to falsely reduce their expenditures and thereby increase their available budget for new signings.</p>
<p>Al-Khelaifi has denied any knowledge of the existence of this device and insists that he will fight the ruling. However, if upheld, this punishment will deal a major blow to PSG both financially and competitively. Not only will they have to pay a large fine, but they will also be at a disadvantage compared to other clubs when bidding for players in future transfer windows.</p>
<p>This entire debacle could have been avoided if Neymar had not moved to Paris Saint-Germain last summer. Barcelona were willing to meet his financial demands, but he chose PSG instead in an attempt to become the best player in the world. Unfortunately for him and his new team mates, his greed has backfired massively and may cost them dearly in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Paris-Saint-Germain-F-C-Sponsorship-in-Jeopardy-After-Slot-Machine-Scandal"><a href="#Paris-Saint-Germain-F-C-Sponsorship-in-Jeopardy-After-Slot-Machine-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Sponsorship in Jeopardy After Slot Machine Scandal"></a>Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Sponsorship in Jeopardy After Slot Machine Scandal</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, one of the most popular teams in Europe, has been in hot water after accusations of illegal gambling by several of its top players. The club is now in danger of losing its sponsorships, which could be a major financial hit.</p>
<p>According to reports, several PSG players were caught on camera using a slot machine at a casino in the city of Aix-en-Provence. The team has denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations could do serious damage to the club’s image.</p>
<p>Sponsors are already beginning to distance themselves from PSG. Casino mogul Bernard Tapie has already said that he will not renew his sponsorship deal with the team when it expires at the end of the season. And telecommunications giant Orange has also hinted that it may end its partnership with PSG if the allegations are confirmed.</p>
<p>This could be a huge blow for PSG, which is estimated to earn millions of euros in sponsorship deals each year. The team is currently under investigation by French authorities, and it’s possible that it could face sanctions from both UEFA and Ligue de Football Professionnel.</p>
<h1 id="Paris-Saint-Germain-F-C-CEO-Blames-Slot-Machine-for-Poor-Performance"><a href="#Paris-Saint-Germain-F-C-CEO-Blames-Slot-Machine-for-Poor-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Paris Saint-Germain F.C. CEO Blames Slot Machine for Poor Performance"></a>Paris Saint-Germain F.C. CEO Blames Slot Machine for Poor Performance</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain F.C, who is currently the second most popular football club in the world, have been on a bit of a decline as of late. Last year they were runners up in Ligue 1, and this year they sit in third place with only 6 matches left to play. Some fans are attributing this to the new manager, Thomas Tuchel, who was brought in from Borussia Dortmund to replace Unai Emery; while others believe that Neymar’s high salary demands and injuries are to blame.</p>
<p>However, according to PSG’s CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the root of all their problems can be traced back to their slot machines. In an interview with French broadcaster TF1, he said:</p>
<p>“We have had some problems on the pitch this season but it’s not because of the coach or Neymar – it’s because of our slot machines. We have too many of them and they are sucking all of our money away.”</p>
<p>Slot machines have been a thorn in PSG’s side for years now; ever since they were banned from advertising them in France in 2010. This is because studies have shown that they are highly addictive and can be detrimental to people’s finances. In fact, a 2017 study by France Stratégie found that around 15% of French citizens over the age of 18 are pathological gamblers, meaning that they cannot control their gambling addiction and it has a negative impact on their life.</p>
<p>Al-Khelaifi went on to say that he wants to get rid of all of PSG’s slot machines, but he admitted that this won’t be easy because they are owned by the club’s Qatari owners:</p>
<p>“It won’t be easy but we will do everything we can to get rid of them. The Qataris agree with me that we need to get rid of them, but it won’t be easy because they are very lucrative for us.”</p>
<p>Despite his statement about the slot machines, Al-Khelaifi refused to lay all the blame at their feet and instead said that the team needs to start playing better if they want to win silverware:</p>
<p>“The players need to start performing on the pitch if we want to achieve our goals. We need to start winning trophies again and I am confident that Thomas Tuchel can help us do that. Neymar is also coming back soon so I am sure things will improve soon.”</p>

What Will the Future Hold for Paris Saint-Germain F.C.? Contraband Slot Machine a Serious Blow"></a>Slot Device Causes Controversy at Paris Saint-Germain F.C.5. What Will the Future Hold for Paris Saint-Germain F.C.? Contraband Slot Machine a Serious Blow</h1><p>To their Season</p>
<p>PSG’s sporting director, Antero Henrique, is currently in the hot seat after it was announced that a slot machine had been discovered in the club’s dressing room. This is not the first time that Henrique has been under fire, as he has also been criticised for his transfer policy. The decision to bring in Neymar last summer for a world record fee of £200 million raised eyebrows, and many have questioned whether or not the Brazilian is worth such an investment.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding the slot machine means that Henrique is now facing even more criticism, and there are calls for him to be sacked. This latest incident comes at a bad time for PSG, who are struggling in the league this season. They currently sit in second place behind Monaco, and they risk being knocked out of the Champions League if they don’t beat Spanish side Real Madrid in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie.</p>
<p>It is clear that PSG need to focus on their football, and the controversy surrounding the slot machine is only going to distract them from their goal of winning silverware. Henrique must take responsibility for this mess and step down from his position at the club. If he doesn’t, then PSG run the risk of becoming a laughing stock.</p>
