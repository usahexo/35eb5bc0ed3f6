Ask Real Madrid"></a>What is the vig in sports betting in sin city? Ask Real Madrid</h1><p>In sports betting in sin city, vig (or juice) is the commission or tax that the sportsbook takes on a losing bet. In other words, it’s the price of doing business. The vig is expressed as a percentage of the original bet amount, and it varies depending on the sport and the particular casino.</p>
<p>What Is the Vig?</p>
<p>In sports betting, vig (sometimes called juice) is the commission or tax that the sportsbook takes on a losing bet. In other words, it’s the price of doing business. The vig is expressed as a percentage of the original bet amount, and it varies depending on the sport and the particular casino.</p>
<p>Most sportsbooks charge anywhere from 10% to 15% on NFL and college football bets. NBA and college basketball bets typically have a vig of around 20%, while baseball and hockey bets generally have a vig of around 25%. The house edge on blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, and most other casino games is significantly higher than those percentages, which is why most serious gamblers focus their efforts squarely on sports betting.</p>
<p>How to Minimize the Vig</p>
<p>There are two ways to minimize the vig: by betting against the favorite (known as betting underdogs) or by parlaying bets (laying multiple wagers on a single ticket). Betting against the favorite reduces your chances of winning but also reduces the size of your potential losses if you do lose. Parlaying bets allows you to win more money when you do win, but it also increases your risk if any one of your bets loses.</p>
<p>No matter what approach you take, always be sure to shop around for the best possible odds before placing your bet. Sportsbooks will offer different lines for different games, so it’s important to find one that gives you the best chance to make money.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-odds-makers-set-line-on-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Las-Vegas-odds-makers-set-line-on-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas odds makers set line on Real Madrid"></a>Las Vegas odds makers set line on Real Madrid</h1><p>In what will be the biggest match of the 2017-2018 season so far, Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid will host eternal rivals Barcelona in the second leg of their Copa Del Rey semifinal matchup.</p>
<p>As expected, Las Vegas odds makers have set a line on the outcome of this marquee match, with Real Madrid installed as a -135 favorite to win at home. Barcelona, who won the first leg 3-0, are given a +115 payout if they can pull off the upset and advance to the final.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about betting on this game, there are a few things you should know. First of all, Real Madrid are almost certain to field a stronger lineup than they did in the first leg. Gareth Bale is expected to start after missing that game due to injury, and Luka Modric could also return from injury. Additionally, head coach Zinedine Zidane is likely to want to make sure his team is well primed for their upcoming Champions League clash against Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Barcelona may be without their star striker Lionel Messi due to a hamstring injury sustained in their victory over Leganes over the weekend. Even if Messi does play, he may not be at 100 percent fitness, which could hamper Barca’s chances of advancing.</p>
<p>All things considered, Real Madrid are still strong favorites to win this match and move on to the final. If you want to place a wager on this game, doing so at -135 is your best bet.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-bookmakers-take-bets-on-Real-Madrid"><a href="#Sports-bookmakers-take-bets-on-Real-Madrid" class="headerlink" title="Sports bookmakers take bets on Real Madrid"></a>Sports bookmakers take bets on Real Madrid</h1><p>When it comes to sports betting, the biggest and most popular sporting event in the world is undoubtedly the World Cup. However, there are other events that also attract a great deal of attention from both sports bettors and bookmakers, such as the Super Bowl, major golf tournaments, and horse races. One event that is steadily gaining in popularity among bettors is the UEFA Champions League, which pits Europe’s top football clubs against each other in a series of knockout matches.</p>
<p>One team that always seems to be a favourite among bettors is Real Madrid. The Spanish powerhouse has won the Champions League a record 12 times and always seems to be in contention for the title. This year, Madrid will once again be one of the favourites to win the tournament, and their odds are currently listed at 4&#x2F;1 at many online sportsbooks.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about placing a bet on Real Madrid in this year’s Champions League, there are a few things you need to know. First of all, you should know that Madrid typically performs better in the latter stages of the tournament. They have reached at least the semi-finals in each of the last six years, and they are definitely capable of going all the way this year.</p>
<p>Second, you need to keep an eye on Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese superstar is often the difference maker for Madrid, and he has been especially prolific in recent years in the Champions League. In fact, Ronaldo has scored more goals than any other player in Champions League history. So if you’re looking for a player who can make a difference, Ronaldo is your best option.</p>
<p>Finally, you should be aware that Madrid doesn’t always have an easy path to the title. This year they will face some tough competition from teams like Barcelona, Juventus, and Manchester City. So if you’re thinking about betting on Madrid, it’s important to do your research first and make sure you understand all of the odds involved.</p>
<p>Overall, betting on Real Madrid can be a risky proposition but it can also be very rewarding if they manage to win the tournament. So if you’re feeling bold this year, why not put some money on Los Blancos? You might just end up winning big!</p>
<h1 id="In-Vegas-sports-books-favor-Real-Madrid-to-win"><a href="#In-Vegas-sports-books-favor-Real-Madrid-to-win" class="headerlink" title="In Vegas, sports books favor Real Madrid to win"></a>In Vegas, sports books favor Real Madrid to win</h1><p>The first leg of the UEFA Champions League semifinal is set for Tuesday night, as Real Madrid visits Juventus in Turin.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that Las Vegas sports books have installed Madrid as a favorite in this matchup, giving the Blancos a -180 odds (meaning you would have to wager $180 to win $100) to advance to the final, while Juventus has +150 odds (meaning a $100 bet would win you $150).</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Madrid is also the favorite to win the entire Champions League tournament at +165 odds, while Juventus lags behind at +700. So even though they’re facing one of Europe’s top clubs in the semifinals, Los Blancos are still seen as having a good chance to win it all.</p>
<p>In their two meetings during the group stage of this year’s competition, Madrid took four points from Juventus, with both matches ending in draws. That being said, Juve will be looking for revenge after losing 2-1 to Madrid in last year’s Champions League final.</p>
<p>This semifinal should be a very entertaining match, pitting two of Europe’s top teams against each other. Let’s take a closer look at how both squads matchup:</p>
<p>Goalkeepers: Both Gianluigi Buffon and Keylor Navas are among the best keepers in the world, but Buffon has had the edge this season. The 39-year-old Italian has been spectacular for Juventus this year, keeping 18 clean sheets in 36 appearances in all competitions. Navas, on the other hand, has not been quite as consistent for Madrid and has let in some big goals recently. However, he did play very well in last year’s Champions League final and will likely be up for this match against his former club. Edge: Juve</p>
<p>Defenders: Dani Carvajal and Marcelo have been two of Madrid’s best players this season and will likely be tasked with stopping Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain on Tuesday night. Both players have plenty of Champions League experience and will be looking to shut down Juve’s attack. In terms of center backs, Raphael Varane has been very solid for Madrid while Giorgio Chiellini is always a threat for Juventus. Overall though, Madrid seems to have the stronger defense. Edge: Madrid</p>
<p>Midfielders: Luka Modric has had an excellent season for Madrid and is one of the front runners for player of the year honors. He’ll anchor the midfield alongside Toni Kroos who is also coming into this match in good form. For Juventus, Miralem Pjanic has been one of their most important players this season and will need to be on top form if they hope to control possession against Madrid. Sami Khedira is also back from injury and could start in place of Claudio Marchisio who is suspended for Tuesday night’s match. Edge: Even</p>
<h1 id="Real-Madrid-a-favorite-for-Sin-City-sports-bettors"><a href="#Real-Madrid-a-favorite-for-Sin-City-sports-bettors" class="headerlink" title="Real Madrid a favorite for Sin City sports bettors"></a>Real Madrid a favorite for Sin City sports bettors</h1><p>The first stop on the International Champions Cup is in Las Vegas, and soccer fans are looking at the odds for who will win. Real Madrid is currently a favorite, but Juventus, Manchester United, and Barcelona are all close contenders.</p>
<p>Las Vegas sports bookmakers believe that Los Blancos have a good chance to take home the trophy. Manager Zinedine Zidane has been vocal about his excitement to play in the United States and prepare for the new season.</p>
<p>“Preparation is very important for us and we’re all really looking forward to getting started in this competition. We want to win it,” said Zidane.</p>
<p>Many of the top players on Real Madrid are expected to participate in the ICC tournament, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Keylor Navas. The team is coming off of a successful season where they won both La Liga and the Champions League.</p>
<p>Juventus is another top contender in this year’s ICC. They were runners-up in last year’s Champions League and have brought back most of their key players including Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala.</p>
<p>Manchester United had a disappointing season last year but they are still one of the most popular clubs in the world. New manager Jose Mourinho will be looking to win his first trophy with the team. They also have some of the best players in the world including Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku, and David de Gea.</p>
<p>Barcelona has always been one of the top teams in Europe, but they had a rough season last year after losing Neymar last summer. New manager Ernesto Valverde will be looking to get them back on track this season. They have some great players including Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Andres Iniesta, and Gerard Pique.</p>
