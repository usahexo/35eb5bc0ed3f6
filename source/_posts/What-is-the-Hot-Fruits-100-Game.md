#  Who is Albert Einstein? 

Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".

He is also known for his famous equation, E = mc², which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. Einstein played a major role in the development of quantum mechanics. He is considered one of the pioneers of modern physics and one of its most influential theorists.

Albert Einstein was born on March 14th, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. When he was just five years old, his family moved to Munich. There, he attended elementary and secondary school. In 1895, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to pursue a degree in mathematics and physics.

After graduating from college in 1900, Einstein worked as a patent clerk in Bern. He married Mileva Marić in 1903; they had two sons but later divorced. In 1905, while still working at the patent office, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that laid the foundation for modern physics. The first paper introduced special relativity; the second explained the photoelectric effect; the third presented Brownian motion; and the fourth proposed a theory of general relativity.

In 1916, Einstein divorced Marić and married his cousin Elsa Lowenthal. The couple had two more children together. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and emigrated to America. He became a professor at Princeton University, where he remained until his death on April 18th 1955.

Albert Einstein's work has had a profound and lasting influence on physics and on our understanding of the universe.
