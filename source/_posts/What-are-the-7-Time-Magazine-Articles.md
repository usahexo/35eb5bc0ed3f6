#  What are the 7 Time Magazine Articles?

The 7 Time Magazine Articles are a series of seven articles that were published by Time Magazine between 1933 and 1944. The series is made up of six articles that focus on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime in Germany, as well as one article on the persecution of the Jews in Europe. The articles provide an in-depth look at the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, their policies and actions, and the effects that they had on the people and countries surrounding Germany.

The first article in the series, "Hitler's Coming Victory", was published in 1933 and covers Hitler's rise to power and his early policies. The article paints a bleak picture of the future under Nazi rule, with quotes from Hitler himself such as: "Germany will either be a world power or there will be no Germany."

The second article, "Inside Nazi Germany", was published in 1934 and provides a more detailed look at life inside Nazi Germany. This includes information on Hitler's ideology, the Gestapo secret police, propaganda, and German rearmament.

The third article, "The Nazis' Road to Power", was also published in 1934 and looks at how the Nazis came to power in Germany. It covers topics such as the Reichstag fire, the Enabling Act, unemployment, and SA violence.

Article four, "How Hitler Rules Germany", was published in 1935 and looks at how Hitler has consolidated his power since coming to power. It includes information on censorship, propaganda, education policy, the economy, and relations with other countries.

Article five, "A Year of Triumphs for Hitler", was published in 1936 and looks at some of Hitler's biggest achievements over the past year. These include his re-election as Chancellor, taking control of the Rhineland region of Germany, organizing the Olympics in Berlin, and annexing Austria into Nazi Germany.

Article six, "Jews Face Hard Times in Europe", was published in 1938 and looks at how Jews were being persecuted all over Europe by Nazi forces. It covers topics such as anti-Semitism laws, concentration camps, Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass), emigration/extermination policies, and resistance efforts by Jews.

The final article in the series is "Europeans Ask: 'WhatKindofManisHitler?' ", which was published in 1944 towards the end of World War II. In it, various European leaders offer their opinions on Adolf Hitler - from those who see him as a great leader to those who believe he is insane.

#  What is the purpose of the articles?

The main purpose of this article is to help you understand what the blockchain technology is and its benefits. Additionally, we will discuss some projects that are utilizing this technology to create efficiencies in various industries.

# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as "completed" blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to differentiate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.

# Why Use Blockchain?

The blockchain network has no central authority; it is managed by a network of users who work together to maintain the integrity of the ledger. This creates a system that is censorship-resistant and tamper-evident. Transactions on the blockchain are also irrefutable because they are embedded in the block chain as a permanent and time-stamped record.

# Benefits of Blockchain Technology:

1 - Increased security and transparency: The blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can be verified by anyone viewing it, which eliminates the need for a third party to manage transactions. This also increases security because hacking into one node wouldn't give hackers access to the entire network. 2 - Faster and cheaper international payments: Blockchain technology allows us to make faster and cheaper international payments than traditional banking systems. For example, IBM and KlickEx have partnered to use blockchain technology to reduce settlement times for international payments from days down to seconds. 3 - Reduced costs for businesses: By removing intermediaries from financial and contractual processes, blockchain technology can reduce costs for businesses by up to $20 billion per year by 2030. 4 - Improved efficiency: The distributed nature of the blockchain allows businesses to streamline their operations by eliminating the need for third-party verification. 5 - Creation of new opportunities: The applications for blockchain technology are limitless, so new opportunities are constantly being created. Some examples include using blockchain for tracking goods through supply chains, creating digital identities, or enabling micropayments.
