#  Why Do Blackjack Dealers Slide Their Own Arm Around the Table?

Dealers at blackjack tables slide their arms around the table for a few reasons. One reason is that it looks cool and makes the game more exciting for players. It also helps the dealers keep track of their cards and keeps them in position so they can deal promptly. Finally, it also helps to create a physical barrier between the dealers and the players, which can help create a more professional atmosphere at the table.

A blackjack dealer's job is to deal the cards and keep track of the score. They must ensure that the game is played fairly and that players are following the rules. Dealers also need to know when to hit and when to stand.

Most dealers use a sliding arm motion to deal the cards. This motion keeps the cards flowing smoothly and prevents them from getting bunched up. It also looks impressive to the players.

Some dealers use a tapping motion instead of a sliding motion. This is also acceptable, although it can slow down the game a bit.

When dealing cards, dealers should always grip the cards tightly and move them swiftly from hand to hand. This will help prevent cards from being accidentally revealed.

#  Do Blackjack Dealers Love To Touch Themselves?

There is a lot of speculation that blackjack dealers love to touch themselves. Many people believe that this is the reason why they tend to deal the cards so fast. Is there any truth to this allegation, or is it simply a baseless rumor?

One theory is that blackjack dealers do it to pass the time. It can be a pretty boring job, so they might find ways to amuse themselves. Another possibility is that they are trying to get revenge on the players. Maybe they feel like the players are taking advantage of them, so they decide to take matters into their own hands.

There is also the possibility that blackjack dealers are doing it for sexual gratification. This might seem like a strange thing for someone in that line of work to do, but it’s actually not that uncommon. Some people get turned on by touching themselves in public places.

So what’s the truth? We may never know for sure, but there is certainly some evidence that suggests blackjack dealers do enjoy touching themselves. One study found that nearly 60 percent of dealers admitted to masturbating at work at least once per month. That’s a pretty high number, and it seems to suggest that self-pleasure is definitely something that many dealers enjoy.

#  What's The Deal With Blackjack Dealer's Arms?

When you're playing blackjack, the dealer is one of the most important people at the table. After all, it's their job to make sure the game runs smoothly and to keep track of all the bets. But do you know what their arms are for?

The truth is, blackjack dealers have a few different purposes for their arms. Here are three things you should know about them:

1. Dealers use their arms to hold and shuffle cards.

One of the most important things dealers do is shuffle cards. They use their arms to hold and mix up the cards before dealing them out to players. This is an important part of keeping the game fair and preventing cheating.

2. Dealers use their arms to signal when it's time to bet.

Dealers also use their arms to let players know when it's time to bet. When they're ready to deal, they'll slowly extend one arm outwards towards the players. This is your cue to place your bets for that round!

3. Dealers use their arms to collect chips from players.

After each hand, dealers will use their arms to collect chips from winning players and pay out chips to losing players. This can be a bit tricky, so be sure to pay attention so you know how much money you're taking home (or losing!) after each round!
