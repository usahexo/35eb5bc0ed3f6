Slot machines are electronic devices that use randomized number generators to produce outcomes on which people can bet money. They have been around in various forms since the late 1800s, and the modern form we know today was developed in the early 1980s. There are now many different types of slot machines, but the most common are those that use three or five reels with symbols that players match up in order to win cash prizes. 
Because slot machines rely on electronic programming instead of human intervention, they can sometimes malfunction. When this happens, you may need to reset the machine before it will work again. In this article, we will explain how to reset an IGT 2000s slot machine. 
First, we will cover how to access the reset button on the machine. On most IGT 2000s slot machines, the reset button is located at the bottom of the cabinet, just above the coin tray (see image below). In some cases, there may be a cover over the reset button that needs to be removed before it can be accessed. If this is the case, use a small screwdriver or knife to pry open the cover. 
Once you have located the reset button, press it firmly for about five seconds until the machine resets itself and starts up again. If this does not fix the problem, you may need to contact customer service for assistance.
