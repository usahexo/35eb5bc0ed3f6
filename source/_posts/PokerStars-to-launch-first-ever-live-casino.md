#  PokerStars to launch first-ever live casino

In what is seen as a landmark moment for the online gambling sector, PokerStars has announced that it will launch the first-ever live casino.

The new product, which is due to go live in Q2 2019, will give players the chance to enjoy traditional casino games such as blackjack and roulette in a real-world setting.

The live casino will be based in The Isle of Man and will feature a range of high-quality tables and dealers.

In a statement, David Baazov, CEO of PokerStars owner Amaya Gaming, said: "This is an important milestone for PokerStars as we continue to expand our product offering and provide our customers with the most authentic casino experience possible.

"The Isle of Man is the perfect location for our first live casino given its well-established gaming industry and experienced workforce."

The move is seen as a response to the growing popularity of live dealer games, which allow players to interact with real-life dealers via webcam.

According to research from Playtech, the market for live dealer games is expected to grow by over 25% in 2019.

#  PokerStars to offer real-money live dealer games

PokerStars is to offer real-money live dealer games from a central studio, according to a report in the [Casino Journal](http://www.casinojournal.com/pokerstars-to-offer-real-money-live-dealer-games/).

The new games will be offered through the PokerStars Casino brand, and will see players able to interact with dealers in real time through video streaming technology.

The move is seen as an attempt by PokerStars to tap into the growing market for live dealer games, which has seen increasing interest among players in recent years.

“We are always looking for ways to give our players the best possible experience and we believe that live dealer games are the next big thing in online gaming,” said Eric Hollreiser, vice president of corporate communications at PokerStars.

Real money live dealer games have traditionally been the domain of land-based casinos, with players able to enjoy games such as blackjack, roulette and baccarat in person with live dealers. However, over the past few years there has been a growing number of online casinos offering such games to their customers.

Live dealer games work by using video streaming technology to allow players to see and interact with dealers at a physical casino location. The games are played out just as they would be in a brick and mortar casino, with players able to make bets and chat with the dealers.

The technology has proved popular with players due to the sense of realism it offers, with many feeling that it allows them to get closer to the action than traditional online casino games. In addition, some players find that playing against live dealers helps them improve their game play skills.

#  The next big thing in the online poker industry: live casinos

Online poker is one of the most popular online casino games. There are many different variants of the game, and each offers its own level of excitement and challenge. However, one issue that has always been faced by online poker players is the lack of a social aspect. This is something that is offered by live casinos, where players can interact with each other, as well as the dealer, in a real-life setting.

This is where live casinos come in. These are online casinos that offer a live casino experience, complete with real dealers and other players. This allows players to enjoy all the excitement of online poker while also enjoying the social aspect that is missing from traditional online casinos. In addition, live casinos also offer a number of other benefits, including better bonuses and more variations of the game.
